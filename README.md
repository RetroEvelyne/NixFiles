# Evie's NixFiles
A Nix flake for my system configuration - WIP.

## Structure
- `./evelyne` - A folder for my home-manager configs (aka my user)
  - `./evelyne/common` - Home configuration available on all systems
- `./systems` - A folder for my system-wide configs
  - `./systems/pogmachine` - System configuration for my desktop (PogMachine)
- `overlays.nix` - A file for my nixpkgs overlays

## Many thanks
- ❤️ Thanks to @SpyHoodle who helped me make this config
